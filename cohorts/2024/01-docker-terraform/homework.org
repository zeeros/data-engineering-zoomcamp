* TODO Docker & SQL
** TODO Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker.

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim
docker --help
#+end_src

Now run the command to get help on the =docker build= command.

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim
docker build --help
#+end_src

Do the same for =docker run=.

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim
docker run --help
#+end_src

Which tag has the following text? - /Automatically remove the container when it exits/

- [ ] =--delete=
- [ ] =--rc=
- [ ] =--rmc=
- [ ] =--rm=

** TODO Understanding docker first run

Run docker with the =python:3.9= image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed (use =pip list=).

What is version of the package =wheel=?

- [ ] =0.42.0=
- [ ] =1.0.0=
- [ ] =23.0.1=
- [ ] =58.1.0=

** TODO Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos.
We'll use the [[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz][green taxi trips from September 2019]].
You will also need the [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv][dataset with zones]].
Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline).

** TODO Count records

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on =2019-09-18=.

Remember that =lpep_pickup_datetime= and =lpep_dropoff_datetime= columns are in the format timestamp (=date= and =hour+min+sec=) and not in =date=.

- [ ] =15767=
- [ ] =15612=
- [ ] =15859=
- [ ] =89009=

** TODO Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance?
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- [ ] =2019-09-18=
- [ ] =2019-09-16=
- [ ] =2019-09-26=
- [ ] =2019-09-21=

** TODO The number of passengers

Consider =lpep_pickup_datetime= in =2019-09-18= and ignore =Borough= has =Unknown=.
Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of =total_amount= superior to 50000?

- [ ] =Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens=
- [ ] =Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan=
- [ ] =Bronx, Manhattan, Queens=
- [ ] =Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island=

** TODO Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name =Astoria= which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's =tip= , not =trip=

- [ ] =Central Park=
- [ ] =Jamaica=
- [ ] =JFK Airport=
- [ ] =Long Island City/Queens Plaza=

* TODO Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform.
Copy the files from the course repo [[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform][here]] to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.

** TODO Creating Resources

After updating the ~main.tf~ and ~variable.tf~ files run:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim
terraform apply
#+end_src

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

** TODO Submitting the solutions

- Form for submitting:
- You can submit your homework multiple times. In this case, only the last submission will be used.

Deadline: 29 January, 23:00 CET

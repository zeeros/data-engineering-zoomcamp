#+title: Module 2 Homework

In case you don't get one option exactly, select the closest one.
For the homework, we'll be working with the [[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/green/download=][green taxi dataset]].
The goal will be to construct an ETL pipeline that loads the data, performs some transformations, and writes the data to a database (and Google Cloud!).
- Create a new pipeline, call it =green_taxi_etl=
- Add a data loader block and use Pandas to read data for the final quarter of 2020 (months =10=, =11=, =12=).
  - You can use the same datatypes and date parsing methods shown in the course.
  - =BONUS=: load the final three months using a for loop and =pd.concat=
- Add a transformer block and perform the following:
  - Remove rows where the passenger count is equal to 0 /or/ the trip distance is equal to zero.
  - Create a new column =lpep_pickup_date= by converting =lpep_pickup_datetime= to a date.
  - Rename columns in Camel Case to Snake Case, e.g.Â =VendorID= to =vendor_id=.
  - Add three assertions:
    - =vendor_id= is one of the existing values in the column (currently)
    - =passenger_count= is greater than 0
    - =trip_distance= is greater than 0
- Using a Postgres data exporter (SQL or Python), write the dataset to a table called =green_taxi= in a schema =mage=. Replace the table if it already exists.
- Write your data as Parquet files to a bucket in GCP, partioned by =lpep_pickup_date=. Use the =pyarrow= library!
- Schedule your pipeline to run daily at 5AM UTC.

* Data Loading

Once the dataset is loaded, what's the shape of the data?

- [X] 266,855 rows x 20 columns
- [ ] 544,898 rows x 18 columns
- [ ] 544,898 rows x 20 columns
- [ ] 133,744 rows x 20 columns

* Data Transformation
** Count rows

Upon filtering the dataset where the passenger count is greater than 0 /and/ the trip distance is greater than zero, how many rows are left?

- [ ] 544,897 rows
- [ ] 266,855 rows
- [X] 139,370 rows
- [ ] 266,856 rows

** Convert =lpep_pickup_date= to date

Which of the following creates a new column =lpep_pickup_date= by converting =lpep_pickup_datetime= to a date?

- [ ] =data = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].date=
- [ ] =data('lpep_pickup_date') = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].date=
- [X] =data['lpep_pickup_date'] = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.date=
- [ ] =data['lpep_pickup_date'] = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].dt().date()=

** Values of =VendorID=

What are the existing values of =VendorID= in the dataset?

- [ ] 1, 2, or 3
- [X] 1 or 2
- [ ] 1, 2, 3, 4
- [ ] 1

** Field names to snake case

How many columns need to be renamed to snake case?

- [ ] 3
- [ ] 6
- [ ] 2
- [X] 4

* Data Exporting

Once exported, how many partitions (folders) are present in Google Cloud?

- [X] 96
- [ ] 56
- [ ] 67
- [ ] 108
